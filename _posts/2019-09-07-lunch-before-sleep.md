## I have a plan

With the experience I gained over the last trip, I decided to plan out my rest time. 
- lunch (or dinner in HK time)
- rest
- breakfast

Not long after departure, lunch is served. Appetizer tastes nice but not so much for the main. The beans looks yellowish and the meat is a bit too salty. But I feel it's a better option that the burger which would make me feel too full (although it taste good!). Good that I am a bit tired and I can rest after the meal is finished. 

Hopefully I would only post again when I am up for breakfast.
