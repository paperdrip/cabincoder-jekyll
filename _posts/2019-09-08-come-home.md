## Come Home

Able to catch a sleep for roughly 5 hours, not bad I would say and feeling much better than last time. Playing game and read my paper book while awaiting for breakfast to serve. I finished everything and realized I haven't taken any photo but anyway, it's just yogurt and some pastry. One thing in common is, spoon is always missed out.

## And the truth is ...

Doing some work from remote is really what I have been fancying and in within a cabin is surely on the top of the list but I have to admit that, the whole blog is indeed developed after I am home. A long time after I left the cabin. 

But I tried every possible way to resemble the environment, better said the constraint. It's really a fun ride and if I have another chance of flying long hours, I will do this again and with the experience I gained, I should be better prepared.

Thank you for reading along and I hope you have as much fun as I do!
