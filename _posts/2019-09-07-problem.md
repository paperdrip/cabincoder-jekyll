## Houston, I've got a problem

Right after the first post, I realize I have a challenge ahead - I have too good of a camera, I mean the file size is too big (even if I am not on a plane). Resizing is needed but I don't have apps that could do that easily in routine.

**Routine.**

OK, that means repetitive task and Shortcuts is just for that. And the post below posted a solution that is very close to [what I need][1]. What I have modified in my flow is the addition of a new dimension and the corresponding ratio (5x4, 1.25). 

And now, I have shrunken the image from 6M to about 200k. Not too bad, huh?
