## Hi and Bye

The plane is now turning, or rolling to be precise and I have a good view on how the ground looks like. In the day or two I spent in Italy, I keep on thinking about the difference between each city I have travelled to - Amsterdam, Veenendaal, Helsinki, Milan, Cologne. Each of the city "tasted" differently, from the shape of the building, to the color and the decoration around the windows. I couldn't tell if I like Italy or not, it is unfair to judge by the short stay I have.
